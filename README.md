## Design files

This board was designed using the [Upverter](https://upverter.com) web service.

The schematic, board layout and bill of materials can be viewed [here](https://upverter.com/Trebuchetindustries/c8ae200d804062f1/Eurorack-Power-Bus/). Exports from Upverter are available in a subdirectory.

The bill of materials lists specific a part number for the 3 LEDs but really any old 3mm through hole (radial) LED should work.

## Design calculations

### LEDs

* Assume 2 volt DC forward drop
* Don't want the LEDs to be especially bright or use much current, 10 mA per LED will be fine
